# C323 Project 7 - Notes App 2: Evan Tomak

This project is a simple notes app that allows the user to create notes containing a title and a description. The user also has the ability to delete and edit the notes.
This project also features user sign in, sign up, and sign out capabilities through firebase authentication as well as a realtime database.

The functionality is described in more detail below:

## User Screen

The following functions/extensions are implemented:

## Notes

The biggest issue I faced was getting familiar with firebase, authentication, and realtime database while tailoring it to this specific implementation. Aside from that, transitioning the code from my previous notes app was not too bad, but I did spend a lot of time getting the hang of the firebase implementation.
